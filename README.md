# Redds_Gallery
An application to help you find out which piece of art you should buy from Redd when he comes to town.

To get things running you're going to need python 3 installed. Someday I'll fix that.

Steps to set up the database:
  1. Get to the setup folder
  2. Open a command window within this folder
  3. Input "python db_setup.py"
  4. Your db should be set up
 
 Steps to run the application
  1. Get to the redds_gallery folder
  2. Open a command window within this folder
  3. Input "python front_end.py"
  4. Type in the item's title that you'd like to find
